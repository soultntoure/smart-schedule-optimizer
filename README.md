    *   **Frontend:** UI to manage subjects and assign them to tasks.

4.  **Personal Preferences:**
    *   **Purpose:** Capture user-specific scheduling constraints and preferences.
    *   **Backend:** A flexible `Preference` model (key-value pairs, or JSONB field) to store details like preferred study times, optimal break durations, subjects preferred at certain times of day, energy level patterns (e.g., 'morning person'), and preferred study environments.
    *   **Frontend:** Dedicated settings/preferences page where users can input and adjust these parameters. Over time, the system will infer and suggest these preferences.

5.  **Intelligent Schedule Generation & Optimization Engine (Core USP):**
    *   **Purpose:** The central intelligence unit that creates and optimizes schedules.
    *   **Backend (Service Layer):** This module will be a Python service within the backend (`backend/app/services/schedule_optimizer.py`). It will:
        *   **Gather Data:** Collect user's active tasks, defined preferences, and potentially historical schedule completion data.
        *   **Apply Constraints:** Incorporate fixed commitments (e.g., class times), task due dates, and user-defined availability.
        *   **Optimization Algorithms:** Utilize heuristics, constraint programming (e.g., `ortools` for more advanced versions), or custom-built algorithms to:
            *   **Allocate Time:** Assign tasks to time blocks based on estimated duration, priority, and difficulty.
            *   **Balance Workload:** Distribute tasks evenly to prevent overload on specific days/times.
            *   **Integrate Preferences:** Prioritize scheduling tasks during preferred times (e.g., math in the morning) and insert optimal breaks.
            *   **Resolve Conflicts:** Identify overlaps and propose re-arrangements.
        *   **Learning & Adaptation:** (Future State) Incorporate simple ML models (`scikit-learn`) to learn from past schedule adherence, actual vs. estimated task completion times, and reported energy levels to refine future scheduling decisions.
    *   **Frontend:** A "Generate Schedule" button, displaying the generated schedule in an intuitive calendar view, with options for manual adjustments and feedback mechanisms.

6.  **Actionable Insights Module:**
    *   **Purpose:** Provide data-driven suggestions to improve study habits and productivity.
    *   **Backend (Service Layer):** Analyze user's historical task completion, schedule adherence, reported focus levels (if captured), and task attributes to identify patterns. For instance, suggesting 'you complete Math tasks faster in the evenings' or 'you tend to procrastinate on tasks with a difficulty rating of 4 or higher.'
    *   **Frontend:** A dashboard section displaying personalized tips, visualizations of study habits, and performance metrics.

### 2.4 Data Model Overview

*   **User:** `id`, `email`, `hashed_password`, `is_active`, `created_at`.
*   **Subject:** `id`, `name`, `description`.
*   **Task:** `id`, `title`, `description`, `due_date`, `estimated_time_minutes`, `difficulty` (1-5), `priority` (1-5), `subject_id` (FK to Subject), `owner_id` (FK to User), `created_at`.

    *   `ScheduleBlock` (JSON Structure within `schedule_data`): `type` (e.g., 'study', 'break', 'extracurricular'), `start_time`, `end_time`, `task_id` (optional FK), `subject_id` (optional FK), `description`.
*   **Preference:** `id`, `user_id` (FK to User), `key` (e.g., 'morning_focus_subject'), `value` (e.g., 'math', '15_minutes').

### 2.5 API Design Principles

*   **RESTful:** Adhere to REST principles for clear, predictable, and stateless communication.
*   **Resource-Oriented:** APIs designed around resources (e.g., `/users`, `/tasks`, `/schedules`).
*   **Versioned:** Use `/api/v1/` prefix for versioning to allow future API changes without breaking existing clients.
*   **Stateless:** No session state on the server, relying on JWT for authentication.
*   **Clear Contracts:** Use Pydantic models for request body validation and response serialization, ensuring strict data types and structures.
*   **Error Handling:** Consistent error response format with appropriate HTTP status codes.

### 2.6 Deployment Strategy

*   **Containerization:** Both frontend and backend applications will be containerized using Docker.
*   **Orchestration:** Docker Compose for local development. For production, deployment will leverage Kubernetes (e.g., AWS EKS, GCP GKE, Azure AKS) for robust scaling, self-healing, and management of microservices.
*   **Database:** A managed PostgreSQL service (e.g., AWS RDS, GCP Cloud SQL) will be used in production for reliability, backups, and ease of management.
*   **CI/CD:** Implement a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipeline to automate testing, building, and deployment of new features.
